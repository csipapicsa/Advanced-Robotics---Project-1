Thoughts:
busy waiting could be shorter long is less accurate adjustments

-----------------------------------

Testing for line following robot using 2 sensors:
Limitations of the current version:
- Always turns left at intersections.
- Does not understand right only intersections, but can follow them when the only option is to "turn" right.

90% of cases where it can go right and straight it goes straight.
100% of cases where it can only go right it goes right.
100% of cases where it can go left it goes left.

Adequate at following line, very few times strays off at T-sections and jiggles.

-----------------------------------

Testing line following robot using 3 sensors:

It is able to turn left at any intersection correctly.
It is able to turn right at corners and left at corners where it is the only option.
It is unable to accurately turn right at intersection where the options are forward and right, it will always go straight.
	this is delibarate, since it is hardcoded to go left when it detects intersections.

It always chooses to go left at intersections if that is an option.

*It stops moving in 5% or less of intersections, due to left/right sensor active but not middle.
*It stops moving when all sensors leave the Black tape.
 Both of the above was fixed, by adding the option of the car to drive in reverse in these situations, 
	and the robot were able to recover doing this.

Improved at following line compared to 2 sensors, never strays off but still jiggles.
